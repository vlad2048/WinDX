Events2Tree.ToTree()
====================
In case of unbalanced push/pop:
	- return the rest of the tree
	- return the unbalanced nodes
	- return all the nodes that were not added as a result (unbalanced nodes + descendents)
	- test all that

UserEvtGenerator.GenerateForNodes()
===================================
Correctly generate MouseEnter/MouseLeave events:
	- when the mouse goes from one node to another, always generate MouseLeave before MouseEnter
	- if node is deleted and the mouse was over it -> generate MouseLeave
	- test all that

Think about how to handle Ctrls changing between the 2 rendering passes
